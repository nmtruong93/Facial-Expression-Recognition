# Facial Expression Recognition Challenge
This repository demonstrates the implementation and deployoment of a facial expression recognition deep learning model using Keras, based on the [FER+ paper by Barsoum et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01041).
Collect dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data).

Trained model JSON -> [face_model.h5](https://github.com/piyush2896/Facial-Expression-Recognition-Challenge/blob/master/face_model.json)

## Training model
If you're excited to train model, feel free to get [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VC0s4DqU54caNLfVMMUF2ltRYuZQ1r3I/view?usp=sharing)

You can also take a look at my [notebook](https://github.com/nmtruong93/Facial-Expression-Recognition/blob/master/Facial_Expression_Recognition(FER%2B)/real_time/FER%2B.ipynb) as a reference
